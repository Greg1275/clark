Repo
!!Urgent!!
Hello my fellow bittards. China is lying. 20,000,000+ phone plans were canceled. But wait, aren't all the Chinese citizens, right now, 
required by law to carry a smartphone with all their info just to be able to leave their residents. I don't believe the numbers, nobody does. 
China knows how bad this is and they are hiding it on purpose in fear of causing mass hysteria and fear of financial reprocussions.
Straight men will be willing to suck dick for a slice of bread before this pandemic is over.
Humanities future is suddenly looking very grim. We may just be on the brink of another planetary extinction.
Mark my words, if things keep going how they are. The new #1 cause of human death on this world is going to be from hunger.
We better hope grocery stores will be forced to stay open. It's like a runaway freight train, or domino effect. 
It all starts at unemployment. Our world governments will economically collapse.
The only thing holding this world together right now is healthcare workers and the cashiers at the supermarket.
I have a feeling this is just some kind of sick means of population control, put on by the elites.
This is only phase one. Tighten your seatbelts people. We're all in it for the long haul.
Be safe, be healthy. All the best wishes!
See you guys on the flip side. ‚úåÔ∏èüá®üá¶
