Repo
!!Urgent!!
Hello my fellow bittards. China is lying. 20,000,000+ phone plans were canceled. But wait, aren't all the Chinese citizens, right now, 
required by law to carry a smartphone with all their info just to be able to leave their residents. I don't believe the numbers, nobody does. 
China knows how bad this is and they are hiding it on purpose in fear of causing mass hysteria and fear of financial reprocussions.
Straight men will be willing to suck dick for a slice of bread before this pandemic is over.
Humanities future is suddenly looking very grim. We may just be on the brink of another planetary extinction.
Mark my words, if things keep going how they are. The new #1 cause of human death on this world is going to be from hunger.
We better hope grocery stores will be forced to stay open. It's like a runaway freight train, or domino effect. 
It all starts at unemployment. Our world governments will economically collapse.
The only thing holding this world together right now is healthcare workers and the cashiers at the supermarket.
I have a feeling this is just some kind of sick means of population control, put on by the elites.
This is only phase one. Tighten your seatbelts people. We're all in it for the long haul.


Also whoever is stupid enough to actually believe 5g radio waves are causing this.? 
It‚Äôs a wonder you‚Äôve made it this far in life hahaha. 
What they should have done is create a virus that only targets the stupid people on this world, 
the only reason dumb shits like that are still around is because we‚Äôre nice enough to put warning labels on hazardous product. 
Otherwise poor little Timmy might have accidentally mistook the bleach for water. 
Sure good thing we put warning labels on it because Timmy wouldn‚Äôt have been smart enough to tell the difference. üòÜ
I'm not saying 5 g towers are healthy by any means. But there's absolutely no way that 5g towers caused a virus that was discovered way before they invented 5g technology.
Coronavirus was discovered in the early 2000's. First 5g tower was I'm pretty sure around 2017. 
5 g towers can cause DNA mutations (cancer) but very slowly.. Also the average range on one of them towers is only about 500 meters aswell. 
Any they're only really efficient for use in the cities. On top of that how many radio waves hit earth from outer space everyday that we don't even have the technology to observe yet.
I know what your thinking though, the atmosphere stops the harmful waves. Wrong! Radio waves travel the speed of light clean threw out atmosphere. 
Earth is being bombarded all the time by very high frequency radio waves, much stronger that 5 g.
The damn Sun itself puts out a lot more harmful waves in 1 day than all towers combined in the world.
All signals fall on the electromagnetic spectrum from radio waves, to X-rays, and even visible light.
Phone networks use microwaves of a very specific frequency to deliver the internet to your phone
5G is a very low-frequency form of radiation far below visible light and infrared.
5G is a little higher at 3.4GHz to 3.6GHz, but that's tiny when you consider that microwaves go up to 300GHz.
And visible light comes in at a range of around 430THz to 770THz.
That's more than a thousand times higher than the maximum microwave and 100,000 higher than 5G.
Dangerous radiation, like UV rays, X-rays and gamma rays are also far higher up the spectrum still.

Be safe, be healthy. All the best wishes!
See you guys on the flip side. ‚úåÔ∏èüá®üá¶ 
Or in hell..
